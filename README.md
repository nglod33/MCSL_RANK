# MCSL_RANK
Personal project to automatically catalog mcsl races, and then put them on a website where everyone can see how they stack up

###Important Note###
If the swimmer you are searching for has two words in their last name, ie appearing as "Doe II, John", then you will have to
search there name like so

firstName: II John
lastName: Doe


Another example:
"Doe II Esq, Jane"
firstName: II Esq Jane
lastName: Doe

Any lastname which is hyphenated is treated as one word. Middle names will show up with the first name. Example:

"Doe-Smith, John M."

firstName: John M.

lastName: Doe-Smith
